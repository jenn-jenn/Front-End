Your response goes here!

New skills I have learned are how I should indent to make the code easier to read for others and how to use the MDN resource. It's very organized and easy to use.

The easy part is doing the research (as of now..)

I think the difficult part is knowing what to lookup and figuring out what is the answer. For instance, horizontal rule was mentioned but when I looked that up on MDN, <hr> was not the first thing that popped up. Instead, CSS information were shown first. So then I Googled it and then <hr> showed up. I didn't realize that it was towards the 3rd or 4th page of MDN did <hr> showed up.

So far, I learned to keep trying and not to give up, and also tried to use the forum and see if others have the same problems.
